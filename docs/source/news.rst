STREAM2015 workshop
-------------------
The first workshop in the series STREAM2015 will be held in
Indianapolis on October 27th and 28th. It will focus on application
features and requirements as well as hardware and software systems
needed to support them. More details are available `here
<http://streamingsystems.org/>`__.  Members of the
community are invited to submit a 1-2 page White Paper/Statement of
Interest in areas of relevance to the workshop's scope and
objectives. White papers are due by September 21 and should be sent to
workshop organizers. Participants will be selected based upon
relevance of submissions as well as strategic balance of
expertise. Partial travel support is available

IU an Intel Parallel Computing Center
-------------------------------------
Indiana University is pleased to host a new `Intel Parallel Computing
Center <http://ipcc.soic.iu.edu/>`__ as part of
their longstanding tradition blending industry and academia. Prof. Judy
Qiu heads this new center which also includes Prof. Steven Gottlieb of
the IU Physics Dept. In addition a $320,000 award from Intel will be
used in funding research contributing to the SPIDAL project.

CINET workshop
--------------
A hands-on workshop on the topic of CINET, a web-based network
analysis tool, will be hosted by the Virginia Bioinformatics Institute
at Virginia Tech on July 10 and August 11. All those interested in
learning more about CINET are invited to attend. More information
`here <CINETWorkshop.pdf>`__. In addition, Prof. Judy Qiu hosted a
seminar on data analytics enhancement while attending the CINET
workshop on July 9. Information on this seminar is found below: |
Agenda: 'Towards HPC-ABDS: An Initial Experience Optimizing Hadoop for
Scalable High Performance Data Analytics'.  Meeting link: `here

Kansas, Crandall collaborate on 3-D imaging
-------------------------------------------
Kansas is preparing a 3-D imaging test setup for Dr. Crandall at Indiana
University. This test setup is being designed to help ease integration
of Dr. Crandall's global optimizer work into our 3-D imaging routines.
We are also doing background reading on hidden Markov models and network
flow algorithms for global optimization so that we can better support
the integration.

Qiu named Outstanding Junior Faculty
-------------------------------------
In March 2015, co-PI Prof. Judy Qiu received an Outstanding Junior
Faculty award from Indiana University, as related in this IU
`newsletter <http://news.indiana.edu/releases/iu/2015/03/outstanding-junior-faculty.shtml>`__.

DIBBS progam and SPIDAL news
----------------------------
An October 2014 `article <http://news.indiana.edu/releases/iu/2014/10/big-data-dibbs-grant.shtml>`__
from Indiana University addresses the SPIDAL project and IU faculty
who will be working on it.

Details are given on the DIBBs program, which includes our SPIDAL
project, in an NSF
`announcement <http://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=132880>`__
from Oct. 2014.

The official NSF award announcement for this project can be found
`here <http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1443054>`__.

Included here is a
`link <http://news.iu.edu/releases/iu/2014/10/data-science-masters-degree.shtml>`__
to Indiana University's unveiling of a new Data Science Master's degree
program in Oct. 2014.

One of the first mentions hinting at the motivations which led to SPIDAL
came in an
`article <http://www.hpcwire.com/2014/03/31/hpc-big-data-best-worlds-approach/>`__
in HPCWire newsletter in March 2014.
